# ðŸš€ C++ STL & DSA Practice

This repository contains a curated collection of C++ programs that explore and demonstrate the use of **Standard Template Library (STL)** along with core **Data Structures and Algorithms** concepts.

The code is structured to help understand STL containers, algorithms, and custom comparator techniques useful in coding interviews and competitive programming.

## ðŸ“‚ Topics Covered

- ðŸ“Œ **Vectors** â€“ Dynamic arrays, iteration, sorting, and usage in problems
- ðŸ“Œ **Lists** â€“ Doubly linked lists and common STL operations
- ðŸ“Œ **Stacks** â€“ LIFO structure using STL with classic problems
- ðŸ“Œ **Maps** â€“ Key-value pairs, frequency maps, and ordered/unordered maps
- ðŸ“Œ **Pairs** â€“ Utility structure for pairing data (e.g., sorting by value/index)
- ðŸ“Œ **Custom Comparators** â€“ Using `struct`/`lambda` functions with `sort`, `priority_queue`, etc.
- ðŸ“Œ **Algorithms** â€“ STL algorithms like `sort`, `binary_search`, `lower_bound`, and more

## ðŸ›  How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler (like g++) installed.

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
